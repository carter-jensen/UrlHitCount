# UrlHitCount

Build
---------
If you have .Dotnet Core installed, then you can run this via the Dotnet command in Powershell.

As an example: dotnet .\UrlHitCount.dll C:\Code\UrlHitCount\TestFiles\input.txt

Otherwise, I have also provided an .exe version in the Publish folder. This one is self-contained,
so it can be run without having .Dotnet Core installed.
